<b>When You Canâ€™t Afford to Wait for a Job: The Role of Time Discounting for Own-Account Workers in Developing Countries</b>, with David N. Margolis

This paper explores a fundamental trade-off imposed by frictional labor markets: individuals may work on their own at any time, but they can only take a potentially better-paid wage job after spending some time looking for it, which suggests that intertemporal considerations may affect how people choose their occupation. We formalize this intuition using the standard tools of the job search framework, and we show that a sufficiently high subjective discount rate can justify the choice for own-account work even when it pays less than wage work. We use the simple structure of this model to estimate a lower bound for the subjective discount rate that is implicit in the observed occupational choice of urban own-account workers in Brazil, accounting for the labor market conditions they face (i.e., how long they would need to find a wage job instead, how much they could expect to earn after finding one, and how long this job could last). We find that at least 65% of those workers appear to discount the future at rates superior to those available in the credit market, and we interpret this result as evidence of constrained occupational choice since they would be better off borrowing to finance a job search spell instead of working on their own. Finally, we show that the lower bound implicit time preference we estimated for Brazilian own-account workers is positively associated with their levels of food, clothing, and housing deprivation (more scarcity being associated with a higher discount rate), and negatively associated with access to credit and financial comfort (more liquidity, lower discount). This result is consistent with a potential link between urgent needs and preference for quick, small returns in the labor market, to the detriment of income in the long-term and pointing to the importance of policies supporting the liquidity of job-seekers in developing countries.
