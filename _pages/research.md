<b>[Constrained Own-Account Work in Developing Markets: Evidence from Brazil](../docs/wp-oaw-discount-rate.pdf)</b>, with David N. Margolis

This paper explores a fundamental trade-o imposed by imperfect labor markets: individuals may work on their own at any time, but they can only take a potentially better-paid wage job after spending some time looking for it. First, we formalize this intuition using the standard tools of the job search framework, and we show that a sufficiently high subjective discount rate can rationalize the preference for own-account work even when it pays less than wage work. Next, we use the structure established by the theoretical model to estimate the minimum discount rate that would be consistent with the observed occupational choice of own-account workers in Brazil, given the labor market opportunities they face. In the baseline specification, we nd that 60% of them must discount future consumption at rates strictly superior to the average market rates. This result suggests that (1) intertemporal considerations appear to play a relevant role in occupational choices in this context, and (2) if own-account work is only preferable under such high discount rates, we can classify their choice as a financially constrained one. Finally, we nd that the estimated subjective discount rate lower bound is negatively associated with access to credit and positively associated with measures of food deprivation, supporting a channel between current living conditions, time preferences, and labor market decisions.
