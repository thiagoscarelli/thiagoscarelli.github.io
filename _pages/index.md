#### About me

<hr>

I'm a Ph.D. student at Paris School of Economics (PSE), working on labor, behavior and development topics.

My current research focuses on occupational choices under liquidity constraints in developing countries. [The most recent version of my working papers can be found here]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/research.md %}). My CV is available upon request.
