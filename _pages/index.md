#### Thiago Scarelli

<hr>

I'm a Ph.D. student at Paris School of Economics (PSE), working on labor, behavior and development topics.

My current research focuses on occupational choices under liquidity constraints in developing countries. The most recent version of my working papers can be found in the [research section]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/research.md %}).

My complete [curriculum vitae is available here](../docs/thiago_scarelli_cv.pdf).

Comments and questions are welcome at <em>thiago.scarelli [at] psemail.eu</em>.
