#### Thiago Scarelli

<hr>

Research economist at the Paris School of Economics (PSE). [Curriculum vitae here](../docs/thiago_scarelli_cv.pdf).

My main interest is to investigate issues relevant to developing countries using the tools from labor and behavior economics.

Current research focuses on the occupational choice of own-account workers in Brazil. What share of them can be considered as constrained workers? Why some choose to look for a better job while others remain working on their own, despite the relatively low labor income they receive?

Working papers can be found in the [research section]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/research.md %}).

Comments and queries are welcome at <em>thiago.scarelli [at] psemail.eu</em>.
