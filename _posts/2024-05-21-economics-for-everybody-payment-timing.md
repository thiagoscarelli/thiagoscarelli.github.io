A [3-minute video](https://youtu.be/Lb1RrGsqNJk?si=aPNQ1rj0K6NgHEl5) summarizing my research is featured in a dossier on labor economics organized by the Paris School of Economics for a general audience. The dossier also includes a [comic strip](https://www.calameo.com/read/007484431336e49f5d1c4?authid=N3c8J9ff3RwC&page=1) with drawings from [Samuel Chich](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/chich-samuel/).
