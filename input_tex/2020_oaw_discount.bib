	title = {Self Employment in Developing Countries: a Search-Equilibrium Approach},
	abstract = {Self employment comprises around thirty percent of the workforce in Latin America. Most self
employed evade payroll taxes, have low education, and run small businesses requiring low skills. I
develop and estimate a life cycle search model where workers can be wage earners in the formal or
informal sector, self employed or unemployed. Firms in the formal sector pay payroll and severance
taxes, and in the informal sector, they can be fined. The estimated model (i) reproduces well the
composition of workers over the life cycle as observed in Brazilian Labour Force data, and (ii) shows
that the job value of the self employed is similar to that of informal wage earners. The model is used
as a tool to evaluate the welfare impact of labour market policies, where self employment may be an
option. When simulating an increase in the cost of informality by ten percent, results showed (i)
small impact on employment composition and informality; (ii) significant cost pass-through to
wages in the informal sector, meaning a reduction in the lowest wages in the economy, hence higher
wage inequality. On the other hand, (iii) it led to substantial improvement in the welfare of formal
firms and of all workers. These results prove that taking into account labour market frictions is
important in welfare analyses of policies in multisectoral labour markets. As simulations which
increase the cost of informality suggest, stricter enforcement of labour regulations (at least to a
certain degree) can be a way towards efficient labor markets.},

	abstract = {This paper models economic development as a process of institutional transformation by focusing on the interplay between agents' occupational decisions and the distribution of wealth. Because of capital market imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wage over self-employment, and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with sufficient inequality, however, will there be employment contracts; otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the latter is itself endogenous, we demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model dynamically and studying examples in which initial wealth distributions have long-run effects. In one case the economy develops either widespread cottage industry (self-employment) or factory production (employment contracts), depending on the initial distribution; in the other example, it develops into prosperity or stagnation.},

The present volume fills in where these others leave off. For the last several decades, Gary Fields has been teaching, conducting research, and working as a policy advisor on labor market issues. Policy makers, businesspeople, and researchers know a great deal about how the world's poor work and what has improved conditions for them. We know how the poor have managed to invest in improving their own self-employment earning opportunities. We know what it takes for the private sector to want to set up operations in a developing country, thereby creating jobs and paying the taxes that can be used to build roads and schools and fund social programs. We know how poor-country governments can stimulate economic growth and make that growth more inclusive of the poor. And we know how the development banks, the rich-country governments, and other development organizations can help poor-country governments and other organizations do what they do not have the means to do on their own: create more good jobs, improve earnings levels in the poorer jobs, and enhance the skills and productivity of their working people. This book shares those lessons with you.},

We formulate a dynamic model of farms facing uninsured risks and financial constraints. Farmers derive nonpecuniary benefits from operating their businesses. We estimate the model via simulated minimum distance, matching both production and financial data. We find that financial factors and nonpecuniary benefits are of first-order importance. Collateral constraints and liquidity restrictions inhibit borrowing and the accumulation of capital, especially among high-productivity firms seeking to expand. The nonpecuniary benefits to farming are large and keep small, low-productivity farms in business. Although farmers are risk averse, eliminating uninsured production risk has only modest effects on capital and output.},

We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention: It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments, we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. We discuss how this mechanism might also explain other puzzles of poverty.
Being poor means that resources such as time and money are scarce, and this changes how people who are poor behave.

We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.},

This graduate and practitioner guide, first published in 2000, deals with the study and prediction of consumer choice behaviour, concentrating on stated preference ({SP}) methods - placing decision makers in controlled experiments that yield hypothetical choices - rather than revealed preferences ({RP}) - actual choices in the market.

	abstract = {There are two views as to why people stay poor. The equal opportunity view emphasizes that differences in individual traits like talent or motivation make the poor choose low productivity jobs. The poverty traps view emphasizes that access to opportunities depends on initial wealth and hence poor people have no choice but to work in low productivity jobs. We test the two views using the random allocation of an asset transfer program that gave some of the poorest women in Bangladesh access to the same job opportunities as their wealthier counterparts in the same villages. The data rejects the null of equal opportunities. Exploiting small variation in initial endowments, we estimate the transition equation and find that, if the program pushes individuals above a threshold level of initial assets, then they escape poverty, but, if it does not, they slide back into poverty. Structural estimation of an occupational choice model reveals that almost all beneficiaries are misallocated at baseline and that the gains arising from eliminating misallocation would far exceed the costs. Our findings imply that large one-off transfers that enable people to take on more productive occupations can help alleviate persistent poverty.},
