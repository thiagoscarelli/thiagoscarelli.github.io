To what extent the workers' occupational category (whether someone is an employer, an employee, an own-account worker, or an unpaid family worker) is associated with their material living conditions? Motivated by this question, this short paper looks at the distribution of employment categories over different wealth levels in 1,313 regions from 46 low- and middle-income countries. We find that, despite a wide diversity in the composition of those markets, own-account and family workers are consistently overrepresented among the poorest members of the employed population.

### Financial Constraints and Worker’s Preference over Payment Schedules: Evidence from Ridesharing Drivers

This paper investigates how much workers value a short delay-to-pay and how their financial conditions affect this preference. Leveraging a nationwide experimental survey of ridesharing drivers in Brazil, I document three key findings. First, this population strongly prefers a work arrangement that pays shortly after a task, compared with the alternative of earning a larger amount with a month's delay. Second, individuals from the poorest households are more likely to prioritize quick payment schemes. Finally, the workers' choices when facing this trade-off are affected by how they frame their household liquidity.

### When You Can’t Afford to Wait for a Job: The Role of Time Discounting for Own-Account Workers in Developing Countries (with David N. Margolis)

Frictional labor markets impose a fundamental trade-off: individuals may work on their own at any time, but can only take a potentially better-paid wage job after spending some time looking for it, suggesting that intertemporal considerations affect how people choose their occupation. We formalize this intuition under the job search framework and show that a sufficiently high subjective discount rate can justify the choice for own-account work even when it pays less than wage work. With this simple model, we estimate a lower bound for the discount rate that is implicit in the occupational choice of urban own-account workers in Brazil. We find that at least 65 percent of those workers appear to discount the future at rates superior to those available in the credit market, which suggests constrained occupational choice. Finally, we show that the estimated time preference lower bound is positively associated with food, clothing, and housing deprivation.
