**Worker’s Preferences over Payment Schedules: Evidence from Ridesharing Drivers**

A job is usually characterized as a combination of what people do and how much they are paid for it, with little attention to the fact that work arrangements also define \textit{when} people are paid for their labor. This paper advances this discussion by investigating (a) how much value workers assign to having a shorter interval between their tasks and the associated compensation and (b) what explains potential differences in such valuation between workers. Using a large-scale survey experiment with ridesharing drivers in Brazil, I document that the median driver would be willing to forgo at least a third of their earnings to be paid on the same day of their rides, compared to the alternative of being paid a month later. Text analysis methods indicate that a prompt remuneration tends to be critical if working extra hours is one's primary adjustment mechanism in response to financial emergencies. I also find evidence that stronger preferences for fast payment among ridesharing drivers tend to reflect a structural context of resource scarcity and liquidity constraints, combined with a modest degree of behavioral heuristics that favor quick pay as a default safe choice. Finally, I provide experimental evidence that increasing the salience of their household budget can make workers marginally more likely to prioritize larger over faster earnings.

To what extent is the workers' occupational category (whether someone is an employer, an employee, an own-account worker, or an unpaid family worker) associated with their material living conditions? This short paper looks at the distribution of employment categories over different wealth levels in 1,313 regions from 46 low- and middle-income countries. We find that, despite a wide diversity in the composition of those markets, own-account and family workers are consistently overrepresented among the poorest members of the employed population, as measured by household assets.

**[When You Can’t Afford to Wait for a Job: The Role of Time Discounting for Own-Account Workers in Developing Countries](https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/izaizadps/dp15926.htm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**, with David N. Margolis

Frictional labor markets impose a fundamental trade-off: individuals may work on their own at any time, but can only take a potentially better-paid wage job after spending some time looking for it, suggesting that intertemporal considerations affect how people choose their occupation. We formalize this intuition under the job search framework and show that a sufficiently high subjective discount rate can justify the choice for own-account work even when it pays less than wage work. With this simple model, we estimate a lower bound for the discount rate that is implicit in the occupational choice of urban own-account workers in Brazil. We find that at least 65 percent of those workers appear to discount the future at rates superior to those available in the formal credit market, which suggests constrained occupational choice. Finally, we show that our estimated lower bound of the time preference is positively associated with food, clothing, and housing deprivation.
