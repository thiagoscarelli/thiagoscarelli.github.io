**Workers' Preferences over Payment Schedules: Evidence from Ridesharing Drivers**

A job is usually characterized as a combination of what people do and how much they are paid, with little attention to the fact that work arrangements also define when people are paid for their labor. This paper advances this discussion by investigating (a) how much value workers assign to having a short interval between their tasks and the associated payment and (b) what explains potential differences in such valuation across workers. Using a large-scale survey experiment with ridesharing drivers in Brazil, I document that the median driver would be willing to forgo a third of their earnings to be paid on the same day of their rides, compared to the alternative of being paid a month later. The analysis of a rich corpus of text responses shows that prompt remuneration tends to be more valuable for workers with little savings, limited access to credit, and pressing consumption needs. I also find evidence that quick payment can be a default choice for drivers, who become less likely to prioritize faster over higher earnings after being primed to think about their household budget. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of payment timing in the labor market, emphasizing that quick pay can be a crucial feature for people with few liquidity sources other than their own labor.

**Occupations and Wealth in Developing Countries** 

*Revue d'économie du développement*, 2022

To what extent is the workers' occupational category (whether someone is an employer, an employee, an own-account worker, or an unpaid family worker) associated with their material living conditions? This short paper looks at the distribution of employment categories over different wealth levels in 1,313 regions from 46 low- and middle-income countries. We find that, despite a wide diversity in the composition of those markets, own-account and family workers are consistently overrepresented among the poorest members of the employed population, as measured by household assets.

**When You Can’t Afford to Wait for a Job: The Role of Time Discounting for Own-Account Workers in Developing Countries**, with David N. Margolis

Frictional labor markets impose a fundamental trade-off: individuals may work on their own at any time, but can only take a potentially better-paid wage job after spending some time looking for it, suggesting that intertemporal considerations affect how people choose their occupation. We formalize this intuition under the job search framework and show that a sufficiently high subjective discount rate can justify the choice for own-account work even when it pays less than wage work. With this simple model, we estimate a lower bound for the discount rate that is implicit in the occupational choice of urban own-account workers in Brazil. We find that at least 65 percent of those workers appear to discount the future at rates superior to those available in the formal credit market, which suggests constrained occupational choice. Finally, we show that our estimated lower bound of the time preference is positively associated with food, clothing, and housing deprivation.
