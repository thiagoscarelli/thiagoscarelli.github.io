Lecturer in the Department of Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/people/thiago-scarelli){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

My research interests are in the intersection of Labor Economics and Development Economics.

My work uses semi-structural microeconometrics and field experiments to study the factors shaping people's choices in the labor markets of poor countries.
