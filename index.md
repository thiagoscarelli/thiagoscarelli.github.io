I am an applied microeconomist working on the intersection of labor and development economics. 

My research focuses on the different forms of labor market participation in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular interest in the self-employed and the platform workers.

In my recent papers, I use structural econometrics and experimental field surveys to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more. In my future projects, I will look at the long-term consequences of occupational decisions and evaluate policies to improve labor allocation.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Paris School of Economics (PSE), under the supervision of David N. Margolis, and I teach quantitative research methods at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. During the Spring of 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the University of Chicago, hosted by John List.

I have a master's degree in Economics (2017) from PSE, and two bachelor's degrees, in Economics (2014) and Journalism (2007), from the University of São Paulo. Before my graduate studies, I worked in the finance sector and covered international politics as a journalist.
