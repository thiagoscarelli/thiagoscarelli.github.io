I am an applied microeconomist working on the intersection of labor and development economics. 

My research focuses on the different forms of labor market participation in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular interest in the self-employed and platform workers.

In my recent papers, I use microeconometrics and field experiments to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more. In my future projects, I will look at the long-term consequences of occupational decisions and evaluate policies to improve labor allocation.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/scarelli-thiago/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, under the supervision of David N. Margolis, and I teach quantitative research methods at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. During the Spring of 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the University of Chicago, hosted by John List.
