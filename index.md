I research labor market issues and other microeconomic topics in the context of low- and middle-income countries.

I am currently a Lecturer in Development Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/people/thiago-scarelli){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I am affiliated with St Antony's College, the Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE), and the Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning (CEBRAP).

I received my PhD from the Paris School of Economics (PSE) in 2024. During my graduate studies, I was a visiting researcher in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago.
