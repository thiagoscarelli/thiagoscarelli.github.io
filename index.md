I research labor market issues and other microeconomic topics in the context of low- and middle-income countries.

I am currently a Lecturer in Development Economics at the **University of Oxford**. I am affiliated with the St Antony's College, the Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE), and the Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning (CEBRAP).

I received my PhD from the **Paris School of Economics** in 2024. During my graduate studies, I was a visiting researcher in the Department of Economics at the **University of Chicago**.
