I am a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford. 

I am also affiliated with the Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE), the Oxford Centre for Economic and Social History, and the Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning (CEBRAP). 

My research uses field experiments and statistical models to study labor markets, social protection mechanisms, and public administration in developing countries. 

I earned a PhD from the Paris School of Economics in 2024.
