I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE) + Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/scarelli-thiago/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, supervised by David N. Margolis. I'm currently a visiting researcher at the University of Chicago, working with John List.

My research focuses on the different forms of labor market participation in low and middle-income countries. My current projects investigate the relationship between own-account work and financial stress using structural econometrics and causal inference.

Before joining PSE, I worked in the finance sector and as a journalist in Brazil. I have a BA in Economics and a BA in Journalism, both from the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and a Master's degree in Economics from PSE + École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS).
