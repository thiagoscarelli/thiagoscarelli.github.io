I am a Lecturer in Development Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-economics-development){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

My research focuses on understanding the factors that shape peopleâ€™s careers in low- and middle-income coutries.

My recent papers use microeconometrics and field experiments to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more.
