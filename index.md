I am an applied microeconomist working on the intersection of labor and development economics. 

My research focuses on the different forms of labor market participation in low- and middle-income countries, with particular interest on the self-employed and the platform workers.

In my recent papers, I use structural econometrics and experimental field surveys to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more. In my future projects, I aim to look at the long-term consequences of occupational choices, and evaluate policies to impove the allocation of labor.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Paris School of Economics (PSE), under the supervision of David N. Margolis. During the Spring of 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the University of Chicago, hosted by John List.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Journalism (2007) and Economics (2014) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, and received a masters degree in Economics (2017) from PSE. Prior to my undergraduate studies, I worked in the financial sector, and covered international politics as a journalist.
