I am an applied economist, and my primary research areas are labor and development economics.

My recent papers use microeconometrics and field experiments to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more. 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/scarelli-thiago/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under the supervision of Professor David N. Margolis. 

During the Spring of 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the [University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, hosted by Professor John A. List.

In September 2024, I will join the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-economics-development){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a Departmental Lecturer in Development Economics.
