My research focuses on understanding the factors that shape people's careers and the impact of new technologies in the labor market. 

My recent papers use microeconometrics and field experiments to study how financial stress can push workers to prioritize labor market choices that pay fast over options that pay more. 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/scarelli-thiago/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under the supervision of Professor David N. Margolis. 

During the Spring of 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the [University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, hosted by Professor John A. List.

Later this year, I will join [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-economics-development){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a Departmental Lecturer in Development Economics.
