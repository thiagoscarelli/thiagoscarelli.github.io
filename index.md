I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Paris School of Economics (PSE) and at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.

My research focuses on the different forms of labor market participation in low and middle-income countries. In particular, my current projects investigate the relationship between own-account work and financial stress using structural econometrics and causal inference.

Before joining PSE, I worked in the finance sector and as a journalist in Brazil. I have a BA in Economics and a BA in Journalism, both from the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and a Master's degree in Economics from the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS).
