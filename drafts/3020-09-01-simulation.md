Simulating data if often an easy way to check whether an estimation is working as intended before applying it to real data. The key advantages are that (a) you know exactly how each variable was generated and (b) your sample is as large you need it to be. The question is: in practice, how to simulate draws from an arbitrary distribution?

Some people would say we often simulate because we're too lazy to write down proofs of asymptotic results. If I were to take sides I'd probably be with the lazy ones...

Is it helpful? Is there a mistake somewhere? Did I miss something important? Let me know :)
